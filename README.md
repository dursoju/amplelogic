Common Issues and Solutions

• Node/NPM Version Compatibility: Ensure your Node.js and npm versions are compatible with the Angular CLI version you are using.
• Permission Errors: On Unix-based systems, you might encounter permission errors. Use sudo for installing global packages or change the directory ownership.
• Missing Dependencies: If you encounter missing dependencies, try deleting node_modules and package-lock.json and then run npm install again.
